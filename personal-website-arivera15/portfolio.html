              During my Spring 2024 semester I took the class "Introduction to
              Computer Systems." In this class, the majority of our assigments
              were in C++ over the course of the semester we covered

              such as inter-process communication, threading, and concurrency to
              name a few. Being such a hands-on class, there were several

              us gain a better understanding of them.

              Over the course of the summer, I worked together with a team of
              other students to create a learning app called
              <a

              Similar to Canvas and other such learning sites, teachers would be
              able to assign homework to their students and view their progress
              in the form of a report. My main focus for the duration of the
              project was developing the frontend for the teacher view of the
              app.
