            I was born in Puerto Rico but I was raised in Texas and have lived
            here for almost 16 years. Starting off in 2020 as a freshman at the

            where I am currently set to graduate in May 2025. The journey to get
            this far has been full of its ups and downs but I know this hard
            work will pay off.

            Going into college, I knew next to nothing about programming outside
            of a brief time spent learning HTML and CSS in high school. Despite
            this, I was determined to learn and spent hours both inside and out
            of class trying to expand my skillset. Before I knew it, I had
            gotten a few projects under my belt and was much more confident in
            my coding abilities. Though I am most comfortable with frontend
            development, I also want to become more familiar with full stack
            development.

        <h1>My Goals:</h1>
        <p>
          After I graduate, I intend to work as a software developer where I
          will continue honing my skills as a programmer. While I am quite
          partial to web and app development, I am very much open to pursuing
          any path where I can put my skills to use. However, regardless of
          where I choose to go, I will always aim to excel at what I do and work
          to create something that I can be proud of.
        </p>
        <h1>Why Hire Me?</h1>
        <p>
          I believe that one of my better qualities is my ability to adapt to
          different environments. I can be an excellent team player with the
          drive to go above and beyond in everything I do. On top of that, I am
          more than willing to learn on the job. Being able to further expand my
          skillset and grow as a developer would make me an asset to any team.
