            I plan to serve my community by using my skills to improve the
            quality of life for those in need. I hope to be able to leave a
            positive impact on the world with my own two hands no matter how
            small it may be.

            One such way I did this was by joining the

            program. Together with a group of students we created apps that were
            designed to create a positive social impact. Though the project
            itself was somewhat of a smaller scale, I hope that some day in the
            future I will be able to something much substantial in the same vein
            as what my team and I accomplished during our time working in that
            program.
