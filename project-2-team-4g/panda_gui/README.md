Phase 4 Description

The fourth phase of the project will consist of completing the tool with the final functionality to analyze trends.

    You will have a fully functional prototype GUI that connects via JDBC to the online database that you created.
    You will add features to your fully functional prototype GUI that connects via JDBC to your online database.
    Each person on your team is responsible for at least one of the added features.

Requirements

All Teams
    Product Usage Chart: Given a time window, display a chart (e.g., table, graph, diagram) that depicts the amount of inventory used during that period.

    X-report: This gives sales per hour for the current day of operation. Managers usually run this report to determine whether the "rush" they felt was really a large sales volume or the "lull" they felt really had almost no sales. You can Google this, as it is an industry-standard. This report has no side effects and can be run as often as desired.

    Z-Report: This report is similar to the X-Report, except it is run at the end of the day, when you close and will have no more customers. It gives all the totals for the day and resets the totals to zero for the next day and the next set of X reports. This report has side effects and should only be run once per day.

    New Seasonal Menu Item: The restaurant just got a new seasonal menu item they have never sold before. Provide and demonstrate the ability to add this menu item to their POS (and any associated inventory items).

Teams of 5 or Greater
    Sales Report: Given a time window, display the sales by item from the order history.
