Meeting 1:
During the previous meeting, we discussed the changes we had made during the cycle, including updating the manager, customer, and updating images. We discussed our tasks for Sprint 3 and distributed tasks to everyone. Additionally, we talked about any issues that we might encounter and reviewed our expert panel. There are some design moves that we want to implement, including making the checkout process more visually appealing and accessible.

Meeting 2:
In the first meeting of the sprint we first discussed the rest of the accessibility features we needed to finish. We discussed the current usability problems and we talked about the things we would do to fix this. We talked about the APIâ€™s we were going to use for the user authentication, weather and translating of our app. The last thing we discussed was the design changes we were making to our POS to make it look even more aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, we also finished our expert findings and reviewed the conclusions.
